# BT4016 - Crypto Portfolio Risk Management
This GitHub repository represents a collaborative group project in which I contributed to various components.  
Specifically, my contributions encompass:
1. **Question 1:** Basic analysis and visualizations of the portfolio.
2. **Question 3:** Calculating VaR(5%) for component assets.
3. **Question 5:** Strategy 3 - Moneyness Ranking and Strategy Evaluation.

While I have included the entirety of the codebase for completeness and coherence, it is important to note that Question 5 is dependent on the preceding sections. Moreover, I wish to highlight that Question 5 involves the design of new hedging strategies that my teammates and I devised entirely on our own, without any hints or suggestions from our professor. 

The following contributions were undertaken by my teammates:
- (Zhuo Yunhui) **Question 2:** Markowitz MVO and simulated portfolio value 
- (Lo Yin-Fan) **Question 4:** Options Hedging
- (Lo Yin-Fan) **Question 5:** Strategy 1 - Extended Straddle
- (Zhuo Yunhui) **Question 5:** Strategy 2 - Options Pricing Model

This collaborative effort allows for a comprehensive examination of the project's scope and outcomes. If you have inquiries or require further details, please feel free to reach out. Thank you for your interest.
